                      2021年的论文集，从中找到问题并决定以“为情绪健康而设计”作为主题。经过阅读相关论文，并了解自我效能感、学习压力和学习倦怠等方面，我选定了学习倦怠作为主要问题。最终，基于ICBT技术和相关理论，我试图将劝导式方法和定制化技术融入心理健康工具的设计中，为大学生提供可用的数字心理健康工具。

                    <p style="line-height: 2;">
                      我们提出了一种应用程序，它为职业倦怠患者提供人工智能辅助的恢复治疗，由持有执照的咨询师在规定的时间内介入。此外，该应用程序还提供支持小组，以促进用户与经历过倦怠恢复的人互动。
                      该应用程序将采用哥本哈根倦怠问卷（CBI）来测量用户的倦怠水平，并根据用户的回答，人工智能将为用户设计一个定制的路线图。这个定制的路线图是基于互联网的认知行为疗法（ICBT）技术/步骤的一套方案，这是一种广泛使用的、经过临床验证的减少倦怠的方法。
                      根据从问卷中计算出的倦怠程度，人工智能将决定治疗师介入的频率。用户将拥有一个仪表板，用于跟踪和管理他们在康复过程中的进展，以及有关治疗师会议的信息。
                      此外，该应用程序还将为用户提供一份活动清单，用户可以通过这些活动来放松自己，或者了解其他策略来帮助他们在紧急情况下应对。通过包括支持小组，用户可以获得社会和道德支持，从而提高在线治疗的效果。用户可以随时访问这些经过调整的支持小组。人工智能系统将通过识别小组中的关键词来调整支持小组。

                    <p style="line-height: 2;">
                      倦怠（burnout）一直是心理健康领域的热点话题。心理学中有关倦怠的研究最初起始于工作领域，如今已扩展和细化到学习领域，主要涉及学习倦怠的研究。学习倦怠是一种主要发生在学生身上持续的、负性的、与学习相关的心理状态，这种状态主要表现为身心耗竭、学业疏离和低成就感等方面。观察数据显示，截至2021年，寻求网上心理健康帮助的人数增加了500％，其中45％为18岁以下的年轻人。因此，探讨学习倦怠及其影响因素，并为学生们提供相应的心理健康服务，对维护学生的心身健康具有重要意义。

                    <p style="line-height: 2;">在开展用户研究之前，我思考了以下问题：<br>
                      · 什么是学习倦怠？<br>
                      · 学习倦怠的影响因素有哪些？<br>
                      · 学习倦怠的表现有哪些？<br>
                      针对以上问题，导师建议我通过查阅论文加以解决，通过从上而下的思考路径对问题本身先形成一个理论上的剖析。因此，通过研读文献，我将文献的关键观点总结如下：

                      Problem Analysis:<br>
                      <br>
                      Lack of Mental Health Awareness:<br>
                      Students are not aware of the importance of maintaining good mental health, and how it can impact their academic performance and overall well-being. The problem is further exacerbated by the lack of resources and support available to students for addressing their mental health concerns.<br>
                      <br>
                      High levels of stress and anxiety:<br>
                      Students are facing high levels of stress and anxiety due to academic pressure, financial constraints, and personal issues. This is leading to physical and emotional symptoms such as headaches, fatigue, insomnia, and decreased productivity.<br>
                      <br>
                      Difficulty accessing mental health resources:<br>
                      Students face challenges in accessing mental health resources due to a lack of availability, affordability, and confidentiality. There is also a stigma associated with seeking mental health support, which prevents many students from seeking the help they need.<br>
                      <br>
                      Inadequate time management skills:<br>
                      Many students struggle with managing their time effectively, which leads to increased stress and pressure. Poor time management can also result in compromising other aspects of their health, such as sleep and diet.<br>
                      <br>
                      Lack of social support:<br>
                      Students may not have a supportive social network to turn to when dealing with academic or personal stressors. This can lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness, which can further exacerbate mental health problems.<br>
                      <br>
                      Potential Solutions:<br>
                      <br>
                      Increase Mental Health Awareness:<br>
                      Developing and implementing mental health awareness programs and initiatives can help students understand the importance of maintaining good mental health. These programs can include workshops, webinars, and seminars to educate students about the importance of mental health, how to recognize symptoms, and how to seek support.<br>
                      <br>
                      Develop Time Management Skills:<br>
                      Providing resources and training to help students manage their time effectively can alleviate stress and pressure. This can include providing tools and techniques to help students prioritize their workload and balance their time effectively.<br>
                      <br>
                      Increase Accessibility to Mental Health Resources:<br>
                      Developing a network of affordable and confidential mental health resources can help students access the support they need. This can include counseling services, mental health hotlines, and online resources.<br>
                      <br>
                      Create a Supportive Environment:<br>
                      Establishing a supportive environment can help students feel more comfortable seeking help for their mental health concerns. This can include creating peer support groups, developing mental health programs, and training staff to recognize and respond to student mental health needs.<br>
                      <br>
                      Address Stigma and Barriers to Seeking Help:<br>
                      Working to address the stigma associated with seeking mental health support can help reduce barriers to access. This can include creating campaigns to increase awareness, providing education about mental health, and promoting a culture of openness and support.<br>

                      Introduction:<br>
                      The proposed application is designed to provide AI-assisted recovery therapy to individuals suffering from occupational burnout. It will be an application that will involve licensed counselors and will provide a customized roadmap for recovery. The AI technology will be used to provide a tailor-made roadmap based on the responses provided in the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI). The therapy will involve cognitive-behavioral techniques, which have been clinically validated for reducing burnout. The application will also provide support groups to encourage user interaction with people who have experienced burnout recovery.<br>
                      <br>
                      Functional Requirements:
                      <br>
                      User Login and Signup: Users can create an account with the application using their email or social media credentials. Once logged in, users will be prompted to fill out the CBI questionnaire.<br>
                      <br>
                      Copenhagen Burnout Inventory (CBI) Questionnaire: The application will use the CBI questionnaire to measure the user's level of burnout. The responses will be analyzed by the AI system to provide a tailored recovery plan.<br>
                      <br>
                      AI-Assisted Therapy: Based on the results of the CBI questionnaire, the AI system will design a customized roadmap for the user. The roadmap will include cognitive-behavioral techniques that have been clinically validated for reducing burnout.<br>
                      <br>
                      Dashboard: The user will have access to a dashboard where they can track their progress and access information about their therapy sessions.<br>
                      <br>
                      Counselor Meetings: The user will have access to licensed counselors who will provide therapy sessions at scheduled intervals. The frequency of counselor meetings will depend on the level of burnout calculated from the CBI questionnaire.<br>
                      <br>
                      Support Groups: The application will have support groups where users can interact with others who have experienced burnout recovery. The AI system will adjust the support groups based on the keywords identified in the user's responses.<br>
                      <br>
                      Activity List: The application will provide a list of activities that users can perform to relax or to learn new strategies for coping in stressful situations.<br>
                      <br>
                      Notifications: The application will provide notifications to remind users of scheduled therapy sessions and other important events.<br>
                      <br>
                      Payment Gateway: The application will have a payment gateway to facilitate payments for the therapy sessions.<br>
